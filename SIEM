# Sigma - Generic Signature Format for SIEM Systems
Others provide excellent analyses, include IOCs and YARA rules to detect the malicious files and network connections, but have no way to describe a specific or generic detection method in log events. Sigma is meant to be an open standard in which such detection mechanisms can be defined, shared and collected in order to improve the detection capabilities for everyone.

### üåü Key Features

* A continuously growing list of detection and hunting rules, peer reviewed by a community of professional Detection Engineers.
* Vendor agnostic detection rules.
* Easily shareable across communities and reports

## üèóÔ∏è Rule Creation

To start writing Sigma rules please check the following guides:

* [Rule Creation Guide](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma/wiki/Rule-Creation-Guide)
* [How to Write Sigma Rules - Nextron Systems](https://www.nextron-systems.com/2018/02/10/write-sigma-rules/)

## üîé Contributing & Making PRs

Please refer to the [CONTRIBUTING](./CONTRIBUTING.md) guide for detailed instructions on how you can start contributing new rules.

## üì¶ Rule Packages

You can download the latest rule packages from the [release page](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma/releases/latest) and start leveraging Sigma rules today.

## üß¨ Rule Usage and Conversion

* You can start converting Sigma rules today using [Sigma CLI](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma-cli) or [sigconverter.io](https://sigconverter.io) the GUI interface

* To integrate Sigma rules in your own toolchain or products use [pySigma](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/pySigma).

## üö® Reporting False Positives or New Rule Ideas

If you find a false positive or would like to propose a new detection rule idea but do not have the time to create one, please create a new issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma/issues/new/choose) by selecting one of the available templates.
